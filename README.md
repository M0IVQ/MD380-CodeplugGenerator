# MD380-CodeplugGenerator

Visual Basic 2015 application to generate codeplug files for the Tytera MD380.

The aim is to read repeater data from the internet, along with relevent talkgroups, in order to generate the zones, channels, scan lists etc.

Currently, it will only work on my PC as filenames are hard-coded for testing purposes. Check back here regularly for upates.

I'm new to Github so I may not be doing things properly!!!
