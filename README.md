# MD380-CodeplugGenerator

THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED!
There are many other alternative CPS and codeplug generators for the MD380 written by other authors which contain the same features I intended to include in this software. I have other projects to work on so have decided to discontue work on this one for the time being. However, should you feel there is a feature that is missing from the others that would make it worthwhile for me to continue then please raise it in the issue tracker and I may start working on the project again.


Visual Basic 2015 application to generate codeplug files for the Tytera MD380.

The aim is to read repeater data from the internet, along with relevent talkgroups, in order to generate the zones, channels, scan lists etc.

There's no error handling as yet. Check back here regularly for upates.

I'm new to Github so I may not be doing things properly!!!
